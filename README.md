# ShootThemUp Game

## Overview
This is my first educational project created while learning Unreal Engine 4 game development. ShootThemUp is a shooter game where players can use various weapons, manage ammunition, and engage in combat with visual effects and health management.

## Project Features
- Modular weapon system with base weapon class
- Ammunition management (bullets, clips, infinite ammo)
- Health system with damage handling
- Visual effects using Niagara system and decals
- Game mode configuration (players, rounds, time limits)
- **AI-controlled bot opponents with custom behavior trees**

## Technologies Used
- Unreal Engine 4.26.2
- C++
- **Unreal Engine AI and Behavior Tree system**

## Learning Context
This project was developed as part of learning game development through the Udemy course:
[Unreal Engine â€” Full C++ Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealengine/)

## Project Structure
The main components include:
- Core type definitions (STUCoreTypes.h)
- Base weapon implementation (STUBaseWeapon.h/cpp)
- Game mode setup (STUGameModeBase.cpp)
- **AI controllers and behavior tree components**
- **Navigation mesh for AI movement**

## AI Features
The game includes AI-controlled bots with the following capabilities:
- Pathfinding using Unreal's navigation system
- Enemy detection and targeting
- Combat behavior with weapon usage
- Custom behavior trees for decision making
- State-based actions (patrol, pursuit, attack)
- Perception system for detecting players

## Build and Installation Instructions for Windows

### Prerequisites
1. **Unreal Engine 4.26.2**
   - Download and install the Epic Games Launcher from [Epic Games website](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/download)
